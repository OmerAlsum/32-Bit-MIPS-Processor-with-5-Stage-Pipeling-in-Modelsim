# 32-Bit-MIPS-Processor-with-5-Stage-Pipeling-in-Modelsim
Project Goal is to implement a 32-bit processor with 5 stage pipeline that will be able to execute a program created off the MIPS Instruction Set Architecture

Instructions it support:
Arithmetic/Logic: AND, OR , NOR, ADD, SUB, SLT, ADDI, MULTI, DIV
Data movement: LW , SW, MFHI, and MFLO
Flow control: Beq, j

Will also have a forwarding and harzard unit
